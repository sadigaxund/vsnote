/**
 * Vendored from markii-org/markii (MIT license), pinned to v0.13.0:
 * packages/markii-host/src/insert/component-catalog.ts
 * https://github.com/markii-org/markii/blob/main/packages/markii-host/src/insert/component-catalog.ts
 *
 * `@markii/host` is `private: true` upstream and never published to npm —
 * see docs/PLAN-2026-09-05-refresh.md §6 Phase M1. This file was
 * originally vendored TRIMMED (every pack code path stripped, since VSNote
 * had no pack system before Phase M3) with an explicit breadcrumb:
 * "Re-vendor the full file (and add `@markii/pack`) when Phase M3 lands."
 * `@markii/pack` is now a real dependency (worker 2) — this is that
 * re-vendor, UNTRIMMED, with one adaptation: upstream imports its
 * `DiscoveredPack` type from a sibling, Node-filesystem-based module
 * (`../packs/discover.js`, `@markii/host`'s own folder-scanning pack
 * loader) that has no VSNote equivalent — this app loads packs from
 * `.mkp` ARCHIVE BYTES via `@markii/pack`'s `openPackArchive`
 * (`src/markii/host/packs.ts`'s `EnabledPack`), never from a folder on a
 * real filesystem. `DiscoveredPack` below is redefined locally as the
 * minimal structural shape this file actually reads (`.manifest`) — any
 * `EnabledPack` already satisfies it, so `src/editor/markiiCompletion.ts`
 * passes `EnabledPack[]` straight through with no adapter needed.
 *
 * Original file header:
 * "Insert Component" (GitHub issue #17, slice 1): the flat list of
 * components a picker offers — every `@markii/stdlib` standard component,
 * plus one entry per component every currently discovered pack declares.
 * Host-neutral and pure: no `vscode`, no `obsidian`, no filesystem access
 * of its own (packs are handed in already discovered, via
 * `@markii/host`'s own `discoverPacks`/`DiscoveredPack`).
 *
 * Never throws. A malformed pack (an empty or missing `components` map, or
 * a local name that fails `@markii/pack`'s namespace validation) simply
 * contributes nothing — the same cleanliness posture as `./discover.ts`.
 * A pack component's declared attribute metadata (`pack.json`'s optional
 * `attributes` list, issue #27 slice 4) is carried through untouched;
 * `@markii/pack`'s `packComponents` has already dropped anything malformed
 * in it, so this module never re-validates it.
